    { id: '2', title: 'How do I decide if I need life insurance?', content: 'There are lots of factors that go into deciding whether or not you need life insurance, including how much debt you have and how many dependents rely on you financially. But it all comes down to one question: if something happened to you tomorrow, would your family be able to keep paying their bills? If not, then yesâ€”you should get life insurance.' },
    { id: '3', title: 'How much life insurance do I need?', content: 'A good rule of thumb is to have life insurance coverage that is equal to 10-12 times your annual income. However, this can vary depending on your personal financial situation. You should consider factors such as your debts, mortgage, education expenses, and any other financial obligations your loved ones would have in the event of your demise.' },
    { id: '4', title: 'Should I get term or permanent life insurance?', content: 'Whether to get term or permanent life insurance depends on your needs. Term life insurance covers you for a specific period of time, such as 10 or 20 years, and is often more affordable than permanent life insurance. On the other hand, permanent life insurance provides coverage for your whole life and may have a cash value component. To make the right choice, you should talk to a financial advisor or insurance agent.' },
